            <h2>Author Notes</h2>
            <p>Yesterday I was having so much fun with Wands & Wizards(refer to strip <a href="/0012.html">12</a>) that I forgot to upload yesterday. I am also traveling tomorrow so cannot upload then. So I've uploaded both today. I'm surprised that I'm this responsible.</p>
            <p>I have recently seen the Shrek broomstick mod for Hogwarts Legacy(haven't got a link, just look it up). And I have one question. WHY?</p>
            <p>Also check out the new profile picture YOU can use to spread the word - available in <a href="/about.html">the about page</a>.</p>
            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.</p>
            <p>DM: WHY are you talking to snakes?</p>
            <p>Harry: Did you not read it? It's in my character background!</p>
            <p>DM: You <i>wrote</i> one of those? Umm... In that case...</p>
            <p>DM: He winks.</p>
            <p>Harry: Can you...hear me?</p>
            <p>DM: He nods.</p>
            <p>Harry: It's just...my character description says I've never talked to a snake before.</p>
            <p>Harry: Do you, obviously magic creature, talk to people often?</p>
            <p>DM: He shakes his head.</p>
            <p>Harry: Where's he from?</p>
            <p>DM: The sign says Burma.</p>
            <p>Harry: Nice!</p>
