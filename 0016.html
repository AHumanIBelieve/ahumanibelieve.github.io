            <p>That's right! I'm serious! I've put copyright on the image!</p>
            <p>I would also like to take the opportunity to talk about panel 4 of this comic. I'm sorry, but Uncle Vernon's face is just <i>hilarious</i>. I mean, <i>look at it</i>. Also Petunia's face of... I don't know. I don't know. And I don't want to know.</p>
            <p>I am also surprised that on Friday I did not take the chance to talk about Hogwarts Legacy. As a Switch player, I have to wait until <i>July</i>. I managed to catch the first bit of it on YouTube last night, and it seems great. The opening cutscene is great(which is as far as I got). Also that goblin waking up should be a meme template. However, when I do get my hands on it, I assure you I <i>will</i> be playing Ravenclaw.</p>
            <p>Does anyone know how to get SEO on github pages? Currently the only way to get it on google is to look up 'AHumanIBelieve', and looking up 'Wizards & Potters' brings up the reddit posts I made and the wizarding world website.</p>

            <p>Uncle Vernon: Move!</p>
            <p>Dudley: MOVE!</p>
            <p>Harry: He's asleep!</p>
            <p>Dudley: He's BORING. Let's go somewhere else.</p>
