            <h2>Author Notes</h2>
            <p>Players don't like long monologues, but if they happen to be gamers, I think calling them cutscenes is the way to go. Another weird thing is that a non-medieval DnD campaign is just considered weird. Trying to industrialise a medieval world is okay though, for some reason. In my ongoing campaign, I am the head of a multinational group of taverns. I still have to remind the DM about my paychecks, though.</p>
            <p>Also, about making Dumbledore like, well, how he is, I felt like having an old wise guy who thinks that he is cool would be funny.</p>
            <p>About the schedule of uploads, I'm thinking maybe mondays, thursdays, saturdays, and sundays at noon.This way I can pre-make all the strips for that week and then schedule them.</p>
            <p>Also, to my three readers, happy new year!</p>
            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>DM: Ok. Fine. Look. It'll all be explained. Peter, think of it like a cutscene. Important Backstory. Also, Robert, my last campaign made perfect sense!</p>
            <p>Robert: As much sense as you're making...</p>
            <p>Dumbledore: Lights out, uh-huh, oh yeah.</p>
            <p>VFX: SWOOSH (as the lights go out and fly to dumbledore's Deluminator)</p>
            <p>Peter: Is he okay? Also, why is this not medieval? There are cars!</p>
            <p>DM: Can you please just SHUT UP and let me do this? Please?</p>
