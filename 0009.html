            <p>Its always coming. The character background. I'm guessing the DM here loves roleplaying so he amde the character background really convoluted.</p>
            <p>Another thing: I actually play D&D on Thursdays, so I'm thinking of changing the upload schedule to something in line with DM of the Ring. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays give a nice spread across the week. Should come into force next week.</p>
            <p><s>Comments still aren't working, but they should be fixed soon.</s></p>
            <p><strong>EDIT: </strong>Comments are now working on posts ending with 8 and 9, thanks to the wonderful DeadLyBro on Discuss Disqus. Thanks!</p>
            <p>Sorry for late upload, github pages had a problem</p>
            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>DM: Right. So Peter, you wake up in a dusty cupboard, which is also your bedroom.</p>
            <p>Aunt Petunia: UP! Get up!</p>
            <p>That's your Aunt Petunia, who you've lived with in the 9 years since your parents died.</p>
            <p>Harry: Coming, Aunt Petunia!</p>
            <p>DM: Ever since your parents died in a car crash, you've lived with your Aunt Petunia, your Uncle Vernon and your cousin Dudley. They all abuse you and while Dudley and Uncle Vernon are fat, you are thin and short. Nobody sticks up to for you at school as they don't want to attract the wrath of Dudley, the school bully. Today is Dudley's birthday. You're going to the zoo.</p>
            <p>Harry: Because that's not messed up at all.</p>
            <p>DM: Are you writing this down?</p>
